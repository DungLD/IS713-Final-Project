http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/cry1015	Synopsis Travelling from central Java to the small, coastal town of Jailolo, Indonesian dancer-choreographer Eko Supriyanto began a long journey of discovery and dialogue between himself and the community of this quiet marine haven. Faced with the brute force of modernisation, he discovered that the coral reefs in the oceans of Teluk Jailolo face impending destruction by violent dynamite fishing practices. Working with seven young men from Jailolo, Supriyanto created a powerful moving dance that gives a voice to this situation and the remote coastal community. As the dancers sweep the stage with the rhythmic beats of their bare feet tapping on the stage floor, Supriyanto paints a mesmerising image of hope for the fish to return once again to the reefs, and for the peace of the ocean to be eventually restored to its magnificent beauty. The intensity and solidarity of these young men examines the relationship between the individual and the collective while illuminating Supriyanto's nuanced choreography. A seamless melding of traditional dance from the Jailolo region, with contemporary impulses, Cry Jailolo is a hypnotic dance work that is as compelling as it is graceful.

http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/torobaka1015	Synopsis Akram Khan and Israel Galván-their names together set the scene. Witness the power, passion, and unrestrained expression in a meeting of two celebrated dance masters that treads the boundary between duet and duel, traditional and the contemporary, hunter and beast. Collaborating together for the first time, Khan and Galván draw deeply from their roots in Indian kathak and Spanish flamenco, seeking the essence of movement in the body beyond the dance form. This is not an ethnic exchange between traditions nor an exercise in global dance. It is a creation from a shared way of understanding dance that harks back to the origins of voice and of gesture, before they began to produce meaning. Mimesis rather than mimicry. Accentuated by the rhythms from Khan's ankle bells and bare feet and Galván's flamenco shoes, the dance masters are accompanied on stage by Spanish and Indian musicians who provide stunning live vocals and music. With ferocious masculine intensity and virtuosic brilliance, TOROBAKA is a duet like no other.

http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/ebizo1015	Synopsis Kabuki when broken down, refers to music (ka), dance (bu) and skill (ki). It is an ancient form of Japanese theater dating back to 17th century Japan. Japan Theater is produced and headlined by Ebizo Ichikawa XI, the 'Prince of Kabuki'. In honour of Singapore's 50th year, Ebizo Ichikawa XI's Japan Theater 2015 is proud to present in Singapore, two kabuki plays that have never been seen before, Uwanari and Mimasu Kuruwa no Kasauri. Uwanari is one of the famed Kabuki Juhachiban, a set of eighteen kabuki plays. This old classic has not been performed in a hundred years and will finally be reborn in Singapore. Uwanari, which means "second wife" and "jealousy", is a torrid tale of jealousy, hate, and love. A man divorces his wife and marries another woman. While the newlyweds enjoy marital bliss, the jilted wife fumes and plots her revenge on them. Passions will flare and dark schemes will bloom, through impassioned dance. Mimasu Kuruwa no Kasauri is a brand new play created for Singapore. A charming well-liked umbrella seller earns brisk business until he's beset by ruffians who want a piece of his profits. However, their attempt at intimidation backfires when the umbrella seller reveals himself as Ishikawa Goemon, Japan's greatest thief and outlaw. Ishikawa Goemon soundly beats the thugs and sends them running, and is lauded as a hero by the entire district. Watch Ebizo Ichikawa XI revive the ancient Uwanari play and charm you with Mimasu Kuruwa no Kasauri. Ebizo Ichikawa's aim is to revive the interest in the revered traditional art by making it easier for the audience to appreciate through dance and theatrical movements of Kabuki with traditional classical music. Audiences will not only be amazed and delighted by one of Japan's best living kabuki practitioners, but will also have the opportunity to witness history being made.

http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/eka1115	Synopsis The Hindus believe that the Universe and the human soul are extensions of Eka Brahman, the Supreme Spirit. From eka (one) comes aneka (many), like the creation of these extensions which take on life of their own but are still part of the divine. Their beginnings and ends, when seen as a whole, are therefore a representation of the infinite. Through bharatanatyam, kuchipudi and odissi, Eka Aneka delves into the concept of the infinite, using classical Indian dance as a starting point to explore multiple manifestations of the Supreme One.

http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/milieu1115	Synopsis Milieu is Frontier Danceland's annual end-of-year main stage production that usually presents a double bill - a work choreographed by Artistic Director Low Mei Yoke and a work created by a renowned international choreographer. The latter brings in a cultural perspective and dimension that may differ in varying extends from Singapore's dance scene, thus not only challenging Frontier Danceland's company artists in the way they interpret and execute movement, but also the audience, be it dance practitioners or not, in the way they view contemporary dance. Last year's Milieu presented two different works by overseas choreographers from Taiwan and Israel. This year, however, Frontier Danceland will present a unique full-length work created by artistic director, Low Mei Yoke and rehearsal head/company artist, Christina Chan, with a music score composed by Ho Wen Yang and live music by Ding Yi Music Company. Instead of comparing two separate works, this year's Milieu will integrate the ideas and styles of two different choreographers into one seamless work. The age gap between Low Mei Yoke and Christina Chan spans a period of 33 years, creating space and time for the choreography to reflect the coexistence, collision and communication of mind-sets and ideas that the different generations have. The sound design will resonate something similar; composer/sound designer, Ho Wen Yang, will create a score that musicians from Ding Yi Music Company will play with traditional Chinese instruments, only to contemporize it digitally. The lighting design, created by Gabriel Chan, will also embody the concept of old and new. In this cross-generational, multidisciplinary work, the past and the present meet to create something new that is relatable to both the young and the old, and to all ages in between. The work will explore how the old and new can inspire each other and find a way not just to coexist but to create common goals and exciting new viewpoints and works of expression. Choreographers: Low Mei Yoke & Christina Chan Dancers: Adele Goh, Adrian Skjoldborg, Aymeric Bichon, Christina Chan, Joy Wang, Hwa Wei-An & Wayne Ong from Frontier Danceland Composer/Sound Designer: Ho Wen Yang Musicians: Chin Yen Choong, Chua Yew Kok, Eugene Toh, Kenny Chan & Tan Qing Lun from Ding Yi Music Company Lighting Designer: Gabriel Chan	22.5	25.0	20.0	25.0;20.0

http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/neder1015	Synopsis Programme Schubert by Sol León and Paul Lightfoot Some Other Time by Sol León and Paul Lightfoot mutual comfort by Edward Clug Sara by Sharon Eyal & Gai Behar Cacti by Alexander Ekman One of the world's leading contemporary dance companies returns to the festival with five compelling dance works by renowned choreographers. The evening showcases the exceptional strength, passion and versatility of the virtuosic young dancers from NDT2. Schubert and Some Other Time-works created by celebrated duo Sol León (Artistic Advisor and House Choreographer) and Paul Lightfoot (NDT Artistic Director and House Choreographer) for their 25th anniversary performance-take you "from grinning humour to deep melancholy" (VOLKSRANT). The former is a poetic love story with a highly technical pas de deux danced to Schubert's String Quintet in C, and the latter is a contemplative dream-like work that showcases the emotional dance language of León and Lightfoot. A gleeful parody of the art form's greater excesses, Alexander Ekman's international hit Cacti is an affectionate deconstruction of the love of dance. Cacti has been lauded as "a delight: witty, effervescent, playful, surreal and joyously physical" (The Australian). The award-winning Edward Clug is an inventive force that has been hailed by Tanz magazine as one of the future hopes for dance. His mutual comfort is a detailed and sharply defined work that contains surprising and spontaneous moments of beauty and irony. As a former dancer with the Batsheva Dance Company, Sharon Eyal is a gifted choreographer with a creative voice that is sensual, dramatic and precise. Created together with musician Gai Behar, their first work for NDT, Sara, has been described as "wonderful, but mysterious" (Parool), and is a dance of restrained minimalism where memories, dreams and emotions spring from the subconscious. From expressions of sheer power to elegant whispers of grace, NDT 2 once again brings us a dance presentation that promises to sweep us off our feet.

http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/torobaka1015	Synopsis Akram Khan and Israel Galván-their names together set the scene. Witness the power, passion, and unrestrained expression in a meeting of two celebrated dance masters that treads the boundary between duet and duel, traditional and the contemporary, hunter and beast. Collaborating together for the first time, Khan and Galván draw deeply from their roots in Indian kathak and Spanish flamenco, seeking the essence of movement in the body beyond the dance form. This is not an ethnic exchange between traditions nor an exercise in global dance. It is a creation from a shared way of understanding dance that harks back to the origins of voice and of gesture, before they began to produce meaning. Mimesis rather than mimicry. Accentuated by the rhythms from Khan's ankle bells and bare feet and Galván's flamenco shoes, the dance masters are accompanied on stage by Spanish and Indian musicians who provide stunning live vocals and music. With ferocious masculine intensity and virtuosic brilliance, TOROBAKA is a duet like no other.

http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/contact2015f	Synopsis Feted local choreographer Kuik Swee Boon reworks Pellucid for T.H.E Dance Company, originally created for Singapore Dance Theatre in 2008. The piece revolves upon simplicity. Beauty, when stripped to its bare essentials, fulfils the promise of full richness. The tenderness or callousness of hand upon skin, or a single word. The heart accelerating in the aftermath of a close hug. Coffee in the freshness of morning: heat upon palms, acid upon tongue, neck warmed by the sun. Pellucid resides in these quiet, simple acts. Highly respected in the Indonesian dance scene and an internationally acclaimed choreographer, Jakarta-based artist Jecko Siompo creates a new work for T.H.E Dance Company. This marks the company's first collaboration with a Southeast Asian choreographer outside Singapore. Siompo's inventiveness and physical expression is a seamless fit for the T.H.E and its high-octane performances. His dance vocabulary is a unique mix of Indonesian ethnic dance, contemporary influences, and most distinctly, a kinetic blend of his native tribal Papuan dance culture and the hip-hop, street dance style drawn from American and Indonesian subcultures.	36.0	36.0	36.0	36.0
http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/milieu1115	Synopsis Milieu is Frontier Danceland's annual end-of-year main stage production that usually presents a double bill - a work choreographed by Artistic Director Low Mei Yoke and a work created by a renowned international choreographer. The latter brings in a cultural perspective and dimension that may differ in varying extends from Singapore's dance scene, thus not only challenging Frontier Danceland's company artists in the way they interpret and execute movement, but also the audience, be it dance practitioners or not, in the way they view contemporary dance. Last year's Milieu presented two different works by overseas choreographers from Taiwan and Israel. This year, however, Frontier Danceland will present a unique full-length work created by artistic director, Low Mei Yoke and rehearsal head/company artist, Christina Chan, with a music score composed by Ho Wen Yang and live music by Ding Yi Music Company. Instead of comparing two separate works, this year's Milieu will integrate the ideas and styles of two different choreographers into one seamless work. The age gap between Low Mei Yoke and Christina Chan spans a period of 33 years, creating space and time for the choreography to reflect the coexistence, collision and communication of mind-sets and ideas that the different generations have. The sound design will resonate something similar; composer/sound designer, Ho Wen Yang, will create a score that musicians from Ding Yi Music Company will play with traditional Chinese instruments, only to contemporize it digitally. The lighting design, created by Gabriel Chan, will also embody the concept of old and new. In this cross-generational, multidisciplinary work, the past and the present meet to create something new that is relatable to both the young and the old, and to all ages in between. The work will explore how the old and new can inspire each other and find a way not just to coexist but to create common goals and exciting new viewpoints and works of expression. Choreographers: Low Mei Yoke & Christina Chan Dancers: Adele Goh, Adrian Skjoldborg, Aymeric Bichon, Christina Chan, Joy Wang, Hwa Wei-An & Wayne Ong from Frontier Danceland Composer/Sound Designer: Ho Wen Yang Musicians: Chin Yen Choong, Chua Yew Kok, Eugene Toh, Kenny Chan & Tan Qing Lun from Ding Yi Music Company Lighting Designer: Gabriel Chan	22.5	25.0	20.0	25.0;20.0

http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/cry1015	Synopsis Travelling from central Java to the small, coastal town of Jailolo, Indonesian dancer-choreographer Eko Supriyanto began a long journey of discovery and dialogue between himself and the community of this quiet marine haven. Faced with the brute force of modernisation, he discovered that the coral reefs in the oceans of Teluk Jailolo face impending destruction by violent dynamite fishing practices. Working with seven young men from Jailolo, Supriyanto created a powerful moving dance that gives a voice to this situation and the remote coastal community. As the dancers sweep the stage with the rhythmic beats of their bare feet tapping on the stage floor, Supriyanto paints a mesmerising image of hope for the fish to return once again to the reefs, and for the peace of the ocean to be eventually restored to its magnificent beauty. The intensity and solidarity of these young men examines the relationship between the individual and the collective while illuminating Supriyanto's nuanced choreography. A seamless melding of traditional dance from the Jailolo region, with contemporary impulses, Cry Jailolo is a hypnotic dance work that is as compelling as it is graceful.

http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/eka1115	Synopsis The Hindus believe that the Universe and the human soul are extensions of Eka Brahman, the Supreme Spirit. From eka (one) comes aneka (many), like the creation of these extensions which take on life of their own but are still part of the divine. Their beginnings and ends, when seen as a whole, are therefore a representation of the infinite. Through bharatanatyam, kuchipudi and odissi, Eka Aneka delves into the concept of the infinite, using classical Indian dance as a starting point to explore multiple manifestations of the Supreme One.

http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/neder1015	Synopsis Programme Schubert by Sol León and Paul Lightfoot Some Other Time by Sol León and Paul Lightfoot mutual comfort by Edward Clug Sara by Sharon Eyal & Gai Behar Cacti by Alexander Ekman One of the world's leading contemporary dance companies returns to the festival with five compelling dance works by renowned choreographers. The evening showcases the exceptional strength, passion and versatility of the virtuosic young dancers from NDT2. Schubert and Some Other Time-works created by celebrated duo Sol León (Artistic Advisor and House Choreographer) and Paul Lightfoot (NDT Artistic Director and House Choreographer) for their 25th anniversary performance-take you "from grinning humour to deep melancholy" (VOLKSRANT). The former is a poetic love story with a highly technical pas de deux danced to Schubert's String Quintet in C, and the latter is a contemplative dream-like work that showcases the emotional dance language of León and Lightfoot. A gleeful parody of the art form's greater excesses, Alexander Ekman's international hit Cacti is an affectionate deconstruction of the love of dance. Cacti has been lauded as "a delight: witty, effervescent, playful, surreal and joyously physical" (The Australian). The award-winning Edward Clug is an inventive force that has been hailed by Tanz magazine as one of the future hopes for dance. His mutual comfort is a detailed and sharply defined work that contains surprising and spontaneous moments of beauty and irony. As a former dancer with the Batsheva Dance Company, Sharon Eyal is a gifted choreographer with a creative voice that is sensual, dramatic and precise. Created together with musician Gai Behar, their first work for NDT, Sara, has been described as "wonderful, but mysterious" (Parool), and is a dance of restrained minimalism where memories, dreams and emotions spring from the subconscious. From expressions of sheer power to elegant whispers of grace, NDT 2 once again brings us a dance presentation that promises to sweep us off our feet.
