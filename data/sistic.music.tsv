http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/kennyg1015	Synopsis In a recording career that spans almost three decades and 23 albums, Grammy Award-winning saxophonist Kenny G has grafted elements of R&B;, pop and Latin to a jazz foundation solidifying his reputation as the premiere artist in contemporary jazz. Since the early '80s, his combination of unparalleled instrumental chops and indelible melodies has resulted in sales of more than 75 million records worldwide (45 million in the U.S. alone) and more than a dozen climbs to the top of Billboard's contemporary jazz chart. The sense of conviction is evident from the very first notes of title track, which Kenny considers his favorite piece on the entire record. "There's a melody to this song that you think you've heard a million times, which to me is always the ingredient of a great song," he says. "There's something magical about hearing a melody that sounds so familiar, but knowing at the same time that it isn't." The smoldering "Fall Again" features Thicke on emotionally charged lead vocals that shift effortlessly between tenor and falsetto. "The harmonies are a little darker than usual, and it's very heartfelt," says Kenny. "There's a degree of subtlety to this track that makes it something much more than a pop song." Fueled by a subtle but persistent groove, "No Place Like Home" is slightly more upbeat, thanks in large part to lead vocals by "Babyface" Edmonds, who is also the author of the track. "Babyface and I have been friends for twenty years," says Kenny. "His music is right up my alley. His lyrics, his melodies, the way he puts his grooves together all work really well for me." Further into the set "G-Walkin'" adheres to a steady, uptempo rhythm and makes room for Kenny to open up and lay down some enthusiastic sax lines, while "One Breath" is equally expressive within a slower and more melodic groove.

http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/sio0815	Synopsis 30 years of musical aspirations and reflections Just as words are the language of the mind, music is the language of the soul. In the words of Khalil Gibran, "It opens the secret of life bringing peace, abolishing strife". Music spins the invisible thread that connects people of diverse cultures and unites them as one. "It is a moral law," according to Plato, "[that] gives soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and charm and gaiety to life and to everything". It was music that drew people of different ages, races and nationalities together to form the Singapore Indian Orchestra and Choir (SIOC) 30 years ago, and it is through their lilting music that they continue to mesmerise audiences all over the world. This evening, the SIOC presents an intricately woven tapestry of beautiful melodies that reflect their journey, drawing from their diverse repertoire of traditional, contemporary and fusion music. Innisai Ninaivugal - Musical Memories is a delightful blend of works, reflections and aspirations showcased in three parts and presented with highlights of SIOC's most memorable performances throughout the three decades. Trace the evolution of SIOC, from an orchestra playing traditional Indian music, to a multi-talented ensemble of musicians and choir showcasing world music.	30.0	35.0	25.0	35.0;25.0

http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/cgur1015	Synopsis LAMC Productions is excited to announce that acclaimed Australian folk musician GURRUMUL will make his Singapore debut at the University Cultural Centre Theatre, NUS on Wednesday, 28 October 2015. This will be his only show in Asia this tour. "His music is as approachable as it is otherworldly." — The New York Times The only thing that closely matches the beauty of Gurrumul’s voice is his story. Born blind, Gurrumul grew up as a member of the Gumatj clan on Elcho Island, off the coast of tropical North East Arnhemland. His fragile but powerfully emotive voice has affected the public in a way no other artist has done in Australia. This unique Aboriginal man sings songs about identity, spirit and connection with the land, its elements and the ancestral beings he is related to. His high tenor voice and aura-like persona creates emotion, compassion and a feeling of peacefulness and longing with audiences all around the world. In today’s world where the media and the music industries are based around hype, fashion and disposable artists, Gurrumul has emerged as unique celebrity who allows people to experience his unique Yolngu cultural world through an accessible Western music style and effectively changes their lives for the better. “Gurrumul's songs, like his own life, encompass a span of human experience as great as any on earth.” — NPR Music Rising to prominence with the release of his eponymous debut album in 2008, Gurrumul’s angelic voice connected with listeners worldwide, earning him famous fans such as Elton John, will.i.am and Sting. The debut album Gurrumul has sold half a million copies worldwide to date, reaching 3x platinum in Australia. His second solo album Rralaka (released in April 2011) has hit platinum, which earned him a cover story on Rolling Stone Magazine and the title of “Australia’s Most Important Voice”. "One of the most unusual and emotional and musical voices I've ever heard." — Quincy Jones Among the various world leaders Gurrumul has had the honour of performing for are Her Royal Highness The Queen of England, U.S. President Barack Obama, Crown Prince Frederik and the Princess Mary of Denmark. In addition, he was one of only two Australian performers at the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Concert at Buckingham Palace in 2012, undoubtedly confirming this multiple ARIA award-winning musician’s place as an international star capable of transcending cultural boundaries. Tickets priced at S$148, S$128, S$108 and S$88 will go on sale on Thursday, 6 August 2015 at SISTIC.com.sg and all other SISTIC channels (SISTIC booking fee not included). www.gurrumulusa.com | www.lamcproductions.com	120.5	148.0	98.0	148.0;128.0;108.0;98.0
http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/john1015	Synopsis JOHN MCLAUGHLIN & THE 4TH DIMENSION LIVE IN SINGAPORE 29 OCTOBER 2015, 8PM NUS UNIVERSITY CULTURAL CENTRE HALL On sale 7 September (Monday) Live Nation Lushington is proud to announce JOHN MCLAUGHLIN & THE 4TH DIMENSION Live in Singapore. The legendary guitarist and his band will perform at the NUS University Cultural Centre Hall on 29 October, Thursday. Veteran guitar grandmaster JOHN McLAUGHLIN has earned a place in the top echelon of the six-string pantheon. His virtuosity has been on display in a number of divergent settings throughout his celebrated career, beginning in the early 1960s as the electric guitarist for Georgie Fame's rocking Blue Flames. From there he covered a wide swath of musical territory. In the late '60s and early '70s, he explored electric guitar jazz-rock fusion with Tony Williams's Lifetime and Miles Davis' Bitches Brew, On the Corner and Live at the Cellar Door bands. (It was through McLaughlin's tenure with Miles that he got to work with Chick Corea.) McLaughlin's musical influences carry over to many of the musical elite also declaring him to be "the best guitarist alive," as Jeff Beck mused in 2010. In 2003, McLaughlin was ranked 49th in Rolling Stone magazine list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time" and in the summer of 2007, McLaughlin performed at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival in Bridgeview, Illinois. Chick Corea remarked to DownBeat Magazine that "...what John McLaughlin did with the electric guitar set the world on its ear. No one ever heard an electric guitar played like that before, and it certainly inspired me. John's band, more than my experience with Miles, led me to want to turn the volume up and write music that was more dramatic and made your hair stand on end." McLaughlin's new album "Black Light" will be released this fall and the expansive, emotionally charged new album showcases his virtuoso 4th Dimension. The 4th Dimension is composed of the remarkable multi-instrumentalist Gary Husband on keyboards and drums, Etienne Mbappe's nimble, effervescent electric bass, and the powerhouse drumming of Ranjit Barot. Following the international release of Black Light, McLaughlin and the 4th Dimension will set out on a world tour, continuing to explore and elaborate upon the album's genre-defying material.	114.66666666666667	148.0	88.0	148.0;108.0;88.0

They discussed recording an album of songs mostly by one of the most well loved French composers, Michel Legrand. Legrand is not only known as a composer of beautiful songs and movie scores but is also a formidable jazz pianist with many recordings. In June of 2015, Jeremy and Eugene recorded their album "To Paris With Love" in Europe that will be released before the middle of September 2015. This concert at the newly refurbished Victoria Concert Hall will feature tunes from the album including such Legrand classics as "What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?", "The Summer Knows" and the pop classic "How Do You Keep The Music Playing?" The album and the concert will also feature classic standards that are strongly associated with Michel Legrand such as "Autumn Leaves" and "La Vie En Rose" as well as a Legrand inspired compostion entitled De Paris à Segré (From Paris to Segré) composed by Monteiro and Pao and inspired by their travel from Paris to the town of Segré in France where they have also performed. The Concert will also feature guest appearances by vocalists Alemay Fernandes and Roberto Fernando as well as the the Oxley String Quartet led by Seah Huan Yuh.

http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/cccc1015	Synopsis Key Elements, Singapore's premier acappella group, has a brand-new repertoire that they can't wait to serve up. As you can guesss, these songs fall into three broad categories - the F&B; -themed concert title is a giveaway! The songs under the Coffee section of this musical menu are standards that have been around for a long time. These tunes are as familar as the aroma of the beverage they are classified under, and provide a sense of comfort that a cup of coffee would at the end of a meail. Expect to hear the Gershwin brothers' 'Embraceable You', the Sinatra favourite 'Fly Me to the Moon', and the swingin' 'Lullaby of Birdland'. Cocktails are concoctions that mix sweet syrups and fruit juices with an alcohol kick. For the former, think of jazzy grooves and smooth melodic hooks that slow down the heartbeat and lower the blood pressure - such as 'Between the Sheets' and 'For the Love of You', songs that have been covered respectively by Chaka Khan and Whitney Houston. The kick is represented by booty-shaking opportunities via songs such as Earth, Wind and Fire's brassy 'September' and Pharrell Willams' oh-so-clappable 'Happy'. Finally, Chap Chye, a mixed vegetable stew. Well, the group needed a category to hold songs that come under a mish-mash of other genres. Listen out for local folk song 'Singapura', a rather melancholic version of 'Lover's Tears' (ultimate why-did-you-leave-me? song in Mandarin), and a mash-up of two bossa nova favourites, 'Agua deBeber / Favela' sung in Portuguese, no less. So spend a wonderful, musical evening with Key Elements and place your orders now!	33.0	38.0	28.0	38.0;28.0

http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/ensemble1115	Synopsis The underlying theme of Landscapes is illumination and changes of perception. Arvo Pärt's An den Wassern Zu Babel Saßen Wir Und Weinten (By The Rivers Of Babylon, Psalm 137) was written over a period of several years and exists in different versions; Wu Yu by Chen Yi also exists in an alternative version and is modelled on a Chinese ritual dance but employs western instrumentation; and Deep Red composed by Bright Sheng is written to explore the timbres of the marimba, an instrument which at first sight seems limited in its range of colour and timbre. In Inner Landscapes, from which this concert title is derived, Eric Watson attempts, in musical terms, to present the mosaic quality and non linear process of much of our inner thoughts - the stream of consciousness that James Joyce illustrated in his novel Ulysses.

Yiruma is set to delight audiences with his charming personality and engaging interaction. Last year, an excited fan was randomly selected from the audience for a rare chance to play and compose with him on stage. Says Yiruma about his return to The Star Theatre: It still surprises me till this day that my concert was sold-out the previous time I was in Singapore. I am so glad that I have the opportunity to come back to play for Singapore fans again  and I wish that I can play better than the last time. I hope to see everyone who loves piano music, and my music. With an extensive fan base that includes piano music lovers, piano students, classical enthusiasts and Korean music fans  Yiruma is arguably the most well-loved modern composer-pianist of our time.

http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/sio0815	Synopsis 30 years of musical aspirations and reflections Just as words are the language of the mind, music is the language of the soul. In the words of Khalil Gibran, "It opens the secret of life bringing peace, abolishing strife". Music spins the invisible thread that connects people of diverse cultures and unites them as one. "It is a moral law," according to Plato, "[that] gives soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and charm and gaiety to life and to everything". It was music that drew people of different ages, races and nationalities together to form the Singapore Indian Orchestra and Choir (SIOC) 30 years ago, and it is through their lilting music that they continue to mesmerise audiences all over the world. This evening, the SIOC presents an intricately woven tapestry of beautiful melodies that reflect their journey, drawing from their diverse repertoire of traditional, contemporary and fusion music. Innisai Ninaivugal - Musical Memories is a delightful blend of works, reflections and aspirations showcased in three parts and presented with highlights of SIOC's most memorable performances throughout the three decades. Trace the evolution of SIOC, from an orchestra playing traditional Indian music, to a multi-talented ensemble of musicians and choir showcasing world music.	30.0	35.0	25.0	35.0;25.0

http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/kennyg1015	Synopsis In a recording career that spans almost three decades and 23 albums, Grammy Award-winning saxophonist Kenny G has grafted elements of R&B;, pop and Latin to a jazz foundation solidifying his reputation as the premiere artist in contemporary jazz. Since the early '80s, his combination of unparalleled instrumental chops and indelible melodies has resulted in sales of more than 75 million records worldwide (45 million in the U.S. alone) and more than a dozen climbs to the top of Billboard's contemporary jazz chart. The sense of conviction is evident from the very first notes of title track, which Kenny considers his favorite piece on the entire record. "There's a melody to this song that you think you've heard a million times, which to me is always the ingredient of a great song," he says. "There's something magical about hearing a melody that sounds so familiar, but knowing at the same time that it isn't." The smoldering "Fall Again" features Thicke on emotionally charged lead vocals that shift effortlessly between tenor and falsetto. "The harmonies are a little darker than usual, and it's very heartfelt," says Kenny. "There's a degree of subtlety to this track that makes it something much more than a pop song." Fueled by a subtle but persistent groove, "No Place Like Home" is slightly more upbeat, thanks in large part to lead vocals by "Babyface" Edmonds, who is also the author of the track. "Babyface and I have been friends for twenty years," says Kenny. "His music is right up my alley. His lyrics, his melodies, the way he puts his grooves together all work really well for me." Further into the set "G-Walkin'" adheres to a steady, uptempo rhythm and makes room for Kenny to open up and lay down some enthusiastic sax lines, while "One Breath" is equally expressive within a slower and more melodic groove.

http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/ensemble1115	Synopsis The underlying theme of Landscapes is illumination and changes of perception. Arvo Pärt's An den Wassern Zu Babel Saßen Wir Und Weinten (By The Rivers Of Babylon, Psalm 137) was written over a period of several years and exists in different versions; Wu Yu by Chen Yi also exists in an alternative version and is modelled on a Chinese ritual dance but employs western instrumentation; and Deep Red composed by Bright Sheng is written to explore the timbres of the marimba, an instrument which at first sight seems limited in its range of colour and timbre. In Inner Landscapes, from which this concert title is derived, Eric Watson attempts, in musical terms, to present the mosaic quality and non linear process of much of our inner thoughts - the stream of consciousness that James Joyce illustrated in his novel Ulysses.

Whenever I write a novel, music just sort of naturally slips in..." Haruki Murakami, harukimurakami.com Haruki Murakami is celebrated the world over as one of Japan's most renowned modern writers. Highly regarded for his works of magical realist fiction, his books go beyond excellent storytelling, to unveiling issues concerning humanity and society. A jazz bar owner before becoming a writer, music also underlies the magnificence of Murakami's works. Jazz standards, The Beatles and classical music are frequently cited and waft from the pages of his books, setting the moods lived by his characters. Reading Murakami has often been likened to "flipping through his legendarily expansive record collection". This unique concert experience melds text and music drawn from the pages of Murakami's beloved novels, from Norwegian Wood to 1Q84. Bringing them to life are talented musicians from Japan - the Chihiro Yamanaka Trio and the 1966 Quartet - in collaboration with Singaporean pianist Lim Yan and directed by Kok Heng Leun.	40.0	60.0	20.0	60.0;40.0;20.0
http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/john1015	Synopsis JOHN MCLAUGHLIN & THE 4TH DIMENSION LIVE IN SINGAPORE 29 OCTOBER 2015, 8PM NUS UNIVERSITY CULTURAL CENTRE HALL On sale 7 September (Monday) Live Nation Lushington is proud to announce JOHN MCLAUGHLIN & THE 4TH DIMENSION Live in Singapore. The legendary guitarist and his band will perform at the NUS University Cultural Centre Hall on 29 October, Thursday. Veteran guitar grandmaster JOHN McLAUGHLIN has earned a place in the top echelon of the six-string pantheon. His virtuosity has been on display in a number of divergent settings throughout his celebrated career, beginning in the early 1960s as the electric guitarist for Georgie Fame's rocking Blue Flames. From there he covered a wide swath of musical territory. In the late '60s and early '70s, he explored electric guitar jazz-rock fusion with Tony Williams's Lifetime and Miles Davis' Bitches Brew, On the Corner and Live at the Cellar Door bands. (It was through McLaughlin's tenure with Miles that he got to work with Chick Corea.) McLaughlin's musical influences carry over to many of the musical elite also declaring him to be "the best guitarist alive," as Jeff Beck mused in 2010. In 2003, McLaughlin was ranked 49th in Rolling Stone magazine list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time" and in the summer of 2007, McLaughlin performed at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival in Bridgeview, Illinois. Chick Corea remarked to DownBeat Magazine that "...what John McLaughlin did with the electric guitar set the world on its ear. No one ever heard an electric guitar played like that before, and it certainly inspired me. John's band, more than my experience with Miles, led me to want to turn the volume up and write music that was more dramatic and made your hair stand on end." McLaughlin's new album "Black Light" will be released this fall and the expansive, emotionally charged new album showcases his virtuoso 4th Dimension. The 4th Dimension is composed of the remarkable multi-instrumentalist Gary Husband on keyboards and drums, Etienne Mbappe's nimble, effervescent electric bass, and the powerhouse drumming of Ranjit Barot. Following the international release of Black Light, McLaughlin and the 4th Dimension will set out on a world tour, continuing to explore and elaborate upon the album's genre-defying material.	114.66666666666667	148.0	88.0	148.0;108.0;88.0

http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/cccc1015	Synopsis Key Elements, Singapore's premier acappella group, has a brand-new repertoire that they can't wait to serve up. As you can guesss, these songs fall into three broad categories - the F&B; -themed concert title is a giveaway! The songs under the Coffee section of this musical menu are standards that have been around for a long time. These tunes are as familar as the aroma of the beverage they are classified under, and provide a sense of comfort that a cup of coffee would at the end of a meail. Expect to hear the Gershwin brothers' 'Embraceable You', the Sinatra favourite 'Fly Me to the Moon', and the swingin' 'Lullaby of Birdland'. Cocktails are concoctions that mix sweet syrups and fruit juices with an alcohol kick. For the former, think of jazzy grooves and smooth melodic hooks that slow down the heartbeat and lower the blood pressure - such as 'Between the Sheets' and 'For the Love of You', songs that have been covered respectively by Chaka Khan and Whitney Houston. The kick is represented by booty-shaking opportunities via songs such as Earth, Wind and Fire's brassy 'September' and Pharrell Willams' oh-so-clappable 'Happy'. Finally, Chap Chye, a mixed vegetable stew. Well, the group needed a category to hold songs that come under a mish-mash of other genres. Listen out for local folk song 'Singapura', a rather melancholic version of 'Lover's Tears' (ultimate why-did-you-leave-me? song in Mandarin), and a mash-up of two bossa nova favourites, 'Agua deBeber / Favela' sung in Portuguese, no less.

http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/swf2015k	Synopsis A shared urban phenomenon which once linked Singapore musically to many coastal port towns of Indonesia, kroncong was the product of many centuries of cultural experiments in the Indonesian archipelago. It is the music of the monsoons that brought to our waters not only ships and spices, but the guitar, the accordion, the Portuguese fado, the rhythms of the Ottoman, all seducing the words of the archipelago. The popular sound of our grandparents entertainment heard in movies, amusement parks and parties, kroncong was the Indie music scene that sprouted in the first half of the 20th century. Kroncong Tenggara revives old-time favourites with a newness that can only come from musical virtuosity and years of island hopping research. For the Singapore Writers Festival, the group will also demonstrate the musical dynamics of Indonesian literature by singing the words of contemporary Indonesian poets.

"His music is as approachable as it is otherworldly." — The New York Times The only thing that closely matches the beauty of Gurrumul’s voice is his story. Born blind, Gurrumul grew up as a member of the Gumatj clan on Elcho Island, off the coast of tropical North East Arnhemland. His fragile but powerfully emotive voice has affected the public in a way no other artist has done in Australia. This unique Aboriginal man sings songs about identity, spirit and connection with the land, its elements and the ancestral beings he is related to. His high tenor voice and aura-like persona creates emotion, compassion and a feeling of peacefulness and longing with audiences all around the world. In today’s world where the media and the music industries are based around hype, fashion and disposable artists, Gurrumul has emerged as unique celebrity who allows people to experience his unique Yolngu cultural world through an accessible Western music style and effectively changes their lives for the better. “Gurrumul's songs, like his own life, encompass a span of human experience as great as any on earth.” — NPR Music Rising to prominence with the release of his eponymous debut album in 2008, Gurrumul’s angelic voice connected with listeners worldwide, earning him famous fans such as Elton John, will.i.am and Sting. The debut album Gurrumul has sold half a million copies worldwide to date, reaching 3x platinum in Australia. His second solo album Rralaka (released in April 2011) has hit platinum, which earned him a cover story on Rolling Stone Magazine and the title of “Australia’s Most Important Voice”. "One of the most unusual and emotional and musical voices I've ever heard." — Quincy Jones Among the various world leaders Gurrumul has had the honour of performing for are Her Royal Highness The Queen of England, U.S. President Barack Obama, Crown Prince Frederik and the Princess Mary of Denmark. In addition, he was one of only two Australian performers at the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Concert at Buckingham Palace in 2012, undoubtedly confirming this multiple ARIA award-winning musician’s place as an international star capable of transcending cultural boundaries.
