It tells a story of past-present-future through the voices of border crossers. Real-life border crossers who have never acted before (from Europe, the Americas, and the Asia-Pacific) are invited to be performers in this piece. Sharing their everyday stories as incredible adventures, they inhabit the installation - singing, dancing, and invoking pioneer travellers who were captured by the Lee Brothers Studio in Singapore, a unique photo salon, in 1910. Unlike theatre, this is a performance that's at once installation, karaoke and fashion runway. The Incredible Adventures of Border Crossers is a stunning combination of music, visual culture, live video, fashion, documentary and performance that envisions communications in a not-so-distant future megapolis, amidst a heterotopia of individuals.	45.0	45.0	45.0	45.0

Drama Box explores the dynamics of space in Singapore in It Won't Be Too Long, which blends performance and participation in two arts projects, The Lesson and The Cemetery. The two socially engaged art projects also reflect the different approaches to performance-making that have characterised Drama Box's philosophy for 25 years. Unfolding in two parts (Dawn and Dusk), The Cemetery examines the notion and reality of a burial ground - looking in particular at how Bukit Brown represents loss and being lost. Do we need a new road for economic growth or do we need to hold onto some roots in our land? As Dawn approaches, slip into the rhythms of Bukit Brown in the wee hours of the morning. Watch as the shadows of performers evaporate, giving way to daily routines whilst the sun rises. From the ghostly to the earthly, this experiential event situates us firmly in the Bukit Brown Cemetery, which may disappear as contestations continue. Experience the nature of Bukit Brown in the early morning, a site that has dominated the news in the last year but which you have perhaps never visited. In the Dusk of evening, The Cemetery shifts into the genre of verbatim theatre, directed by Kok Heng Leun and shaped by playwright Jean Tay from the words and experiences of ordinary family members as well as various stakeholders such as the Heritage Society, civil society representatives, institutions and agencies. Discover the heartbreak and hope of everyone involved in negotiating the fate of Bukit Brown. Dusk ends with an elegy to this process led by indie pop band The Observatory.	45.0	45.0	45.0	45.0

The bewitching tale, vividly presented against a series of multilayered sets, features an ensemble cast led by the Japan Academy Award-winning Rie Miyazawa (The Twilight Samurai), and noted actors Naohito Fujiki and Nino Furuhata.

http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/seed1015	Synopsis "Eat something. Most of the time we need things even before we understand why we want them." 「何か食べて。自分が欲しいと思うものは、自分が必要としているものなんだ。理由なんて判らなくてもね。」 A wife travels with her dead husband to his hometown in an unknown place for a final meal with the family. Elsewhere, a woman leaves food outside her door for her lost cat but it is consumed by something else. Yet elsewhere, a mother guides her daughter one last time in the preparation of a meal. In the aftermath of great loss, each person feels the pangs of a spiritual hunger that may only be satiated by the rituals of eating, feasting and fasting. 'SEED' is a work that is planted in the soil of this impossible 'something', growing out of abysmal grief to bear the bittersweet fruits of reconciliation. The ambivalence of mourning is evoked in the Japanese title of the play Ueru (うえる), which can mean 'to grow' (植える) and 'to be hungry' (飢える). Disoriented by tragedy, each character is guided by the primal instinct to eat as they find each other to share a meal, and to find that life continues to grow in spite of the trauma of disaster. Written and directed by award-winning director/playwright Chong Tze Chien, "SEED" make its Singapore premiere after its successful opening in Tokyo.	40.0	45.0	35.0	45.0;40.0;35.0

So obsessed with fashion was he that he decreed that the 50th anniversary of his reign be celebrated with the most extravagant National Dress Parade of all time. But, as he primped and preened, he neglected his music-loving citizens, who could only get his attention by complimenting him on his appearance.

Presenting the Emperor with an eye-popping ensemble literally woven out of thin air, they convince him that only the smartest and most competent people in the land can see it.

http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/autkumar1115	Synopsis Local entertainer Kumar, of former Boom Boom Room fame, dazzles again in “The Really Authentic Kumar”. Well-known for his razor tongued and edgy take on Singapore life, Kumar never fails to make the audience laugh at everyday situations, themselves and others. Most of Kumar’s two decades in the entertainment scene was in glittery drag costume, creating a persona through which he addressed the different characteristics of people and their behaviour. His show at Zouk is in support of Beyond Social Services, a charity supporting children and youths from disadvantaged backgrounds. Drawing inspiration from those who had been touched by the work of Beyond, he has put together a fresh new routine. Kumar authentically addresses social disadvantages and how it impacts the lives of those who get by on very little resources. He also probes into what makes them tick, how they cope, and what inspires them. Rent arrears, a failing marriage, three children, and loan shark trouble and yet the young mother manages to work two jobs and also care for her neighbour’s children. Not possible? Let Kumar share with you these seemingly impossible situations, and how the human spirit triumphs. However bad it may get, everyone can use a smile. Kumar’s generosity of spirit and humility is clearly evident in this show for charity. He is not taking a cent for his appearance, and will involve the people who have shared their stories in his act. Spend an evening with the authentic Kumar, in Zouk (before it moves next year) with friends, and support a good cause. The children, youth and families from Beyond Social Services thank you for your generosity. All proceeds from tickets sales for this charity show go to Beyond Social Services; you are eligible for a 300% tax deduction on your ticket purchase.
