Working with the natural condition of each space, Kim’s choreography creates a seamless impression of organically occurring movement. The dancers engage and react to the surrounding elements, creating an experience that is unique to every performance. Kim’s works possess a signature style that is darkly humorous, stylishly self-composed, and features fast-paced choreography set to beat-driven music. Described by critics as the brainchild behind some of the most attention-grabbing, refreshing and innovative works today, Kim’s pulsating and energetic work will create a dynamic relationship with Esplanade’s physical spaces.	25.666666666666668	30.0	20.0	30.0;20.0;27.0

https://www.esplanade.com/festivals-and-series/dans-festival/2015/tango-legends?GenreNames=Dance&Start=20150915	“Pablo Sosa and Mariela Maldonado added complicated lifts to their numbers and daring speed, their legs cutting and dividing the air like machetes.” The New York Times “The troupe…kept surprising the audience with highly technical and immensely risky moves that we rarely see in tango.” The Nation, Thailand From the heart of Argentina comes the fiery magic of tango. Sensuous, beautiful and soul-moving, it is a language of the body that has transcended cultural boundaries to become a worldwide phenomenon. Tango Legends is inspired by the grand legends and history of this dramatic dance form. Renowned Argentine tango dancers and choreographers Pablo Sosa and Mariela Maldonado, together with their acclaimed troupe that includes 14 award-winning dancers, present a spectacular celebration of tango, complete with a remarkable music band with two skillful singers, dramatic costumes and spellbinding sensuality. These master artists reveal what makes tango legendary, in a breathtaking display that infuses all styles of this passionate dance with their signature glamour. Together, they seek to revive the devotion of the men and women who danced the first tangos. Today, the whole world moves to tango. Its rise from local phenomenon to global fixture was underlined when tango was declared as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2009.

https://www.esplanade.com/festivals-and-series/dans-festival/2015/nederlands-dans-theater-an-evening-of-five-works?GenreNames=Dance&Start=20150915	“NDT 2 is a distinct phenomenon, and phenomenal.” The Independent, UK “A night of superlatives...its ranks are filled with prodigiously talented dancers.” The Straits Times “Every time NDT 2 hits our stages, the usual superlatives fall flat in speechless admiration at 16 dancers, who can handle anything the top-ranking choreographers care to task them with.” The Herald, UK Programme Schubert by Sol León and Paul Lightfoot Some Other Time by Sol León and Paul Lightfoot mutual comfort by Edward Clug Sara by Sharon Eyal Gai Behar Cacti by Alexander Ekman One of the world’s leading contemporary dance companies returns to the festival with five compelling dance works by renowned choreographers. The evening showcases the exceptional strength, passion and versatility of the virtuosic young dancers from NDT2. Schubertand Some Other Time — works created by celebrated duo Sol León (Artistic Advisor and House Choreographer) and Paul Lightfoot (NDT Artistic Director and House Choreographer)for their 25th anniversary performance—take you “from grinning humour to deep melancholy” (VOLKSRANT). The former is a poetic love story with a highly technical pas de deux danced to Schubert’s String Quintet in C, and the latter is a contemplative dream-like work that showcases the emotional dance language of León and Lightfoot. A gleeful parody of the art form’s greater excesses, Alexander Ekman’s international hit Cacti is an affectionate deconstruction of the love of dance. Cacti has been lauded as “a delight: witty, effervescent, playful, surreal and joyously physical” (The Australian). The award-winning Edward Clug is an inventive force that has been hailed by Tanz magazine as one of the future hopes for dance. His mutual comfort is a detailed and sharply defined work that contains surprising and spontaneous moments of beauty and irony. As a former dancer with the Batsheva Dance Company, Sharon Eyal is a gifted choreographer with a creative voice that is sensual, dramatic and precise. Created together with musician Gai Behar, their first work for NDT, Sara, has been described as “wonderful, but mysterious” (Parool), and is a dance of restrained minimalism where memories, dreams and emotions spring from the subconscious. From expressions of sheer power to elegant whispers of grace, NDT 2 once again brings us a dance presentation that promises to sweep us off our feet. About NDT 2 Nederland Dans Theater (NDT) is one of the world’s leading contemporary dance companies. In 1978, NDT founded their junior division, NDT 2, to develop talent and prepare dancers around the world for their further careers. NDT 2 aims to acquaint its dancers with a lexicon of dance languages, and works with young choreographers to offer its dancers the opportunity to work within a range of styles and genres. Their varied repertoire consists of work by established choreographers and upcoming talents. Today, both companies of Nederlands Dans Theater (NDT 1 and NDT 2) are celebrated as two of the world’s most distinctive dance ensembles.

Kuik Swee Boon, Silvia Yong, Jeffrey Tan and Albert Tiong have dedicated their lives to cultivating a professional dance scene in Singapore.

Artistically directed by Kuik Swee Boon, the presentation is a collaborative culmination of four individual artistries, performed with an assured command of the stage that comes from decades-long dedication to their art.	25.666666666666668	30.0	20.0	30.0;20.0;27.0

The flair and virtuosity of her dancing stops you in your tracks.” Evening Standard “Arguably the greatest ballerina of her generation.” The Guardian, UK “The greatest female that I have ever seen and one whose final stage appearances will be mourned by dance lovers around the world.” Sarah Crompton, Daily Telegraph, UK After an unparalleled career that has spanned almost 35 years of both dancing ballet and contemporary work, Sylvie Guillem presents her final dance programme. A world famous dancer with an extensive career at the Paris Opera Ballet, as a Principal Guest Artist at the Royal Ballet and Tokyo Ballet, Guillem has played some iconic roles in ballets by Kenneth MacMillan, Maurice Béjart, Frederick Ashton, William Forsythe and Mats Ek. A Sadler’s Wells Associate Artist since 2006, she has diversified as a dancer forging an undisputable reputation as a major force in the world of contemporary dance. For this very special programme titled Life in Progress, she will dance two new works including techne, a solo with live musicians on stage, choreographed by Sacred Monsters creator Akram Khan. The second will be a duet entitled Here After with Italian dancer Emanuela Montanari from La Scala, by Russell Maliphant who choreographed the award-winning PUSH. The evening’s programme includes Mats Ek’s touching and poignant Bye made especially for her and performed as part of 6000 miles away, and William Forsythe’s Duo, performed by two male dancers, Brigel Gjoka and Riley Watts.

https://www.esplanade.com/festivals-and-series/dans-festival/2015/cry-jailolo?GenreNames=Dance&Start=20150915	Travelling from central Java to the small, coastal town of Jailolo, Indonesian dancer-choreographer Eko Supriyanto began a long journey of discovery and dialogue between himself and the community of this quiet marine haven. Faced with the brute force of modernisation, he discovered that the coral reefs in the oceans of Teluk Jailolo face impending destruction by violent dynamite fishing practices. Working with seven young men from Jailolo, Supriyanto created a powerful moving dance that gives a voice to this situation and the remote coastal community. As the dancers sweep the stage with the rhythmic beats of their bare feet tapping on the stage floor, Supriyanto paints a mesmerising image of hope for the fish to return once again to the reefs, and for the peace of the ocean to be eventually restored to its magnificent beauty. The intensity and solidarity of these young men examines the relationship between the individual and the collective while illuminating Supriyanto’s nuanced choreography. A seamless melding of traditional dance from the Jailolo region, with contemporary impulses, Cry Jailolo is a hypnotic dance work that is as compelling as it is graceful. About Eko Supriyanto From building the local dance scene in Indonesia to an established international career in dance, Eko Supriyanto draws from the values of traditional art while engaging with contemporary realities. His various cross-cultural and cross-discipline explorations propelled him as a featured dancer in Madonna’s Drowned World tour in 2001, and as a dance consultant to Julie Taymor’s Broadway production of The Lion King. With training in several traditional Indonesia dances, such as Javanese Court Dance and the martial art Pencak Silat, as well as contemporary dance, Supriyanto received an MFA in Dance Choreography from UCLA, where he later received a Fulbright scholarship to pursue and complete his Doctorate degree on Performance Studies. In an interview with Jakarta Post, he shared his philosophy, “Everything we do will be successful if we have done it with dedication. I dance with heart. With each choreography, I will deliver a message, whether it’s about the environment or human rights.” More details Less details	25.666666666666668	30.0	20.0	30.0;20.0;27.0

https://www.esplanade.com/festivals-and-series/dans-festival/2015/torobaka?GenreNames=Dance&Start=20150915	“Circling each other, arms whirling, these two superb dancers combine their kathak and flamenco styles with ferocious intensity.” The Guardian “An evening of extraordinary dancing…a blistering dance duel.” The Times “There’s no doubting the genius of all these performers.” The Arts Desk Akram Khan and Israel Galván—their names together set the scene. Witness the power, passion, and unrestrained expression in a meeting of two celebrated dance masters that treads the boundary between duet and duel, traditional and the contemporary, hunter and beast. Collaborating together for the first time, Khan and Galván draw deeply from their roots in Indian kathak and Spanish flamenco, seeking the essence of movement in the body beyond the dance form. This is not an ethnic exchange between traditions nor an exercise in global dance. It is a creation from a shared way of understanding dance that harks back to the origins of voice and of gesture, before they began to produce meaning. Mimesis rather than mimicry. Accentuated by the rhythms from Khan’s ankle bells and bare feet and Galván’s flamenco shoes, the dance masters are accompanied on stage by Spanish and Indian musicians who provide stunning live vocals and music. With ferocious masculine intensity and virtuosic brilliance, TOROBAKA is a duet like no other. “You could say that the seed for TOROBAKA was planted around 600 years ago. That’s when migrant Roma people, originally from northern India, began to arrive in southern Spain, linking the classical Indian dance tradition of kathak with the later development of flamenco.” London Evening Standard About Akram Khan and Israel Galván Masters of their respective traditional dance forms, and recognised groundbreakers unafraid of pushing the limits of their genres, Akram Khan and Israel Galván are award-winning and celebrated icons of the dance world. Their every move is anticipated and studied by dance lovers, critics and scholars the world over.

https://www.esplanade.com/festivals-and-series/dans-festival/2015/softmachine?GenreNames=Dance&Start=20150915	After travelling across Asia to research and interview 88 Asian dance-makers, Singapore artist Choy Ka Fai collaborates with dance artists from four countries to present a performance series from his monumental research project SoftMachine. Through intimate dance portraits, Choy leads us into the deeply personal working lives of choreographers that are negotiating the ever-changing terrain of contemporary dance-making in Asia. From India, Surjit Nongmeikapam breaks out of conservative Manipuri cultures and questions exoticism when creating dance for the consumption of European audiences. From Indonesia, Rianto specialises in the traditional dance of Lengger and explores the personal and societal tensions of gender in dance-making today. From Japan, Yuya Tsukahara, leader of Contact Gonzo, subjects Choy to a brutal contact improvisation duet and interview, where answers are returned in the form of Gonzo’s signature raw physical power. From China, Xiao Ke and Zi Han reflect on the social and political context of their environment, and experiment with the symbolic tendencies of the Chinese dance-maker. Part performance, part interview, and set against documentary films created with each of the artists, Choy’s enquiry investigates the choreographic minds of the present and speculates the possibilities of their futures. SoftMachine will be presented at the ImPulsTanz Festival Vienna, Tanz im August Berlin, Theater Spektakel Zürich, tanzhaus nrw Düsseldorf and Staatstheater Darmstadt, before making its homecoming performance at Esplanade’s da:ns festival, Singapore. About the SoftMachine project and Choy Ka Fai Driven by Choy’s personal desire to study the choreographic processes of Asian contemporary dance over the last decade, SoftMachine is a dance research project exploring the genealogy of contemporary dance in Asia. The SoftMachine exhibition series was presented at the Esplanade Tunnel at 2014’s da:ns festival. Choy Ka Fai is an artist, performance-maker and speculative designer. He is inspired by the histories and theorisations that together contain the uncertainties of the future. His research springs from a desire to understand the conditioning of the human body, its intangible memories and the forces shaping its expressions. These factors converge into complex articulations at the intersection of art, design and technology, forging new territories and notions of dance. Choy graduated in Design Interaction from the Royal College of Art, London, under a National Arts Council (Singapore) Overseas Scholarship, and was conferred the Singapore Young Artist Award in 2010. His work has been presented internationally, notably at Festival Tokyo (2011), Singapore Arts Festival (2012) and Tanz Im August (2013) in Germany.

Worshipped as a sun god (Surya) by Hindu farming nomads in ancient times, it is also known as God of the Flames to the wandering gypsies and the illuminating flame of love in Sufi philosophy. Following the success of productions such as Water, Damaru and Taal Express, the Temple of Fine Arts’ latest presentation, Anthar Agni, is a music and dance tribute to the sacred fire (agni), celebrating its deep spiritual significance as well as influence on Asian and Spanish cultures. Led by 2011 Young Artist Award recipient Nawaz Mirajkar, the concert blends percussive instrumentation, vocals and a mesmerising backdrop of silhouettes against a glowing sun.

From eka (one) comes aneka (many), like the creation of these extensions which take on life of their own but are still part of the divine. Their beginnings and ends, when seen as a whole, are therefore a representation of infinity. Through classical dance forms, bharatanatyam, kuchipudi and odissi, Eka Aneka delves into the concept of infinity, using dance as a starting point to explore multiple manifestations of the Supreme One.

https://www.esplanade.com/festivals-and-series/dans-festival/2015/impulse-a-backstage-site-specific-dance?GenreNames=Dance	In this original site-specific creation by T.H.E Dance Companys resident choreographer from Korea, Kim Jae Duk, unexpected spaces in the Esplanade backstage become the playground for the dancers of T.H.E to think outside the (theatre) box. Working with the natural condition of each space, Kims choreography creates a seamless impression of organically occurring movement. The dancers engage and react to the surrounding elements, creating an experience that is unique to every performance. Kims works possess a signature style that is darkly humorous, stylishly self-composed, and features fast-paced choreography set to beat-driven music. Described by critics as the brainchild behind some of the most attention-grabbing, refreshing and innovative works today, Kims pulsating and energetic work will create a dynamic relationship with Esplanades physical spaces.	25.666666666666668	30.0	20.0	30.0;20.0;27.0

Contemporary movement choreography and sound composition come together with traditional Chinese instruments to explore the coexistence, collision and communication between old and new perspectives and ideas. The work will explore how the old and new can inspire each other and find a way not just to coexist but to create common goals and exciting new viewpoints and works of expression.

https://www.esplanade.com/events/2015/triple-bill-the-dance-company	T.H.E Dance Company (T.H.E) premieres two new collaborations with world-renowned Indonesian choreographer Jecko Siompo, and former principal dancer of Nederlands Dans Theatre Spains Compaia Nacional de Danza, Iratxe Ansa. A revival of T.H.E Artistic Director Kuik Swee Boons early creation Pellucid rounds off this riveting triple bill. Highly respected in the Indonesian dance scene and an internationally acclaimed choreographer, Jakarta-based artist Jecko Siompo creates a new work for T.H.E. This marks the company's first collaboration with a Southeast Asian choreographer outside Singapore. Siompo's inventiveness and physical expression is a seamless fit for the T.H.E and its high-octane performances. His dance vocabulary is a unique mix of Indonesian ethnic dance, contemporary influences, and most distinctly, a kinetic blend of his native tribal Papuan dance culture and the hip-hop, street dance style drawn from American and Indonesian subcultures. Singapore choreographer Kuik Swee Boon reworks Pellucid for T.H.E, originally created for Singapore Dance Theatre in 2008. The piece revolves upon simplicity. Beauty, when stripped to its bare essentials, fulfils the promise of full richness. The tenderness or callousness of hand upon skin, or a single word. The heart accelerating in the aftermath of a close hug. Coffee in the freshness of morning: heat upon palms, acid upon tongue, neck warmed by the sun. Pellucid resides in these quiet, simple acts.
