It was music that drew people of different ages, races and nationalities together to form the Singapore Indian Orchestra and Choir (SIOC) 30 years ago, and it is through their lilting music that they continue to mesmerise audiences all over the world. This evening, the SIOC presents an intricately woven tapestry of beautiful melodies that reflect their journey, drawing from their diverse repertoire of traditional, contemporary and fusion music.

So important are his songs in carnatic music that he is renowned as one of the ‘musical trinity of carnatic music’, along with Tyagaraja and Syama Sastri. Dikshitar’s journey is remarkable.

It was a feat at that time, as he travelled over 1,800km across India, to some of the most important temples in Southern India, including Kasi, Kanchi, Chidambaram, Tirupathi and Tiruvannamalai. There, he composed some of his celebrated pieces, many of which are still widely sung and performed in carnatic concerts. These compositions are known to contain details about temples, the deities within them, and festivals or occasions celebrated there. Upcoming vocalists Sai Vigneshwar, Sudarshan Narasimhan and Nishanth Thiagarajan trace the temple pilgrimages of Dikshitar, exploring compositions dedicated to the temples. They will be accompanied by Nellai Ravindran on violin and Muthu Subramaniam on mridangam. Carnatic Composers is a series of concerts that explores the rich diversity of carnatic music through the composers who have defined and redefined the genre from the 16th century to the present day.	21.5	25.0	18.0	25.0;18.0

Arvo Pärt’s An den Wassern Zu Babel Saßen Wir Und Weinten (By The Rivers Of Babylon, Psalm 137) was written over a period of several years and exists in different versions; Wu Yu by Chen Yi also exists in an alternative version and is modelled on a Chinese ritual dance but employs western instrumentation; and Deep Red composed by Bright Sheng is written to explore the timbres of the marimba, an instrument which at first sight seems limited in its range of colour and timbre. In Inner Landscapes, from which this concert title is derived, Eric Watson deals with the perception of the same musical material from different viewpoints. Inner Landscapes is also an attempt in musical terms to present the non linear process of much of our inner thoughts, the stream of consciousness that James Joyce illustrated in his novel Ulysses.	17.5	20.0	15.0	20.0;15.0

Arvo Prts An den Wassern Zu Babel Saen Wir Und Weinten (By The Rivers Of Babylon, Psalm 137) was written over a period of several years and exists in different versions; Wu Yu by Chen Yi also exists in an alternative version and is modelled on a Chinese ritual dance but employs western instrumentation; and Deep Red composed by Bright Sheng is written to explore the timbres of the marimba, an instrument which at first sight seems limited in its range of colour and timbre. In Inner Landscapes, from which this concert title is derived, Eric Watson deals with the perception of the same musical material from different viewpoints.

https://www.esplanade.com/events/2015/the-songs-we-sang	In the 1980s, a powerful artistic movement was born in Singapore, flourishing amongst the Mandarin-speaking community throughout the island and beyond our shores, leaving an indelible mark on the culture of a young nation. The Songs We Sang, a documentary by Singapore filmmaker Eva Tang, is a vivid and in-depth look into the journey of xinyao (literally songs of Singapore in Mandarin) since its birth. Steeped in history and authenticity, this detailed documentary captures the spirit of a Singapore culture that has since become a significant part of a nations collective cultural heritage. Xinyao emerged from the hearts of students across campuses in Singapore, and soon found its way into the heartlands, capturing the attention of a nation with its tuneful melodies and elegant and meaningful lyrics about family, friendship and everyday life. Taking its title from a pivotal seminar on xinyao held by the Mandarin student publication Nanyang Students in 1982, The Songs We Sang is infused with the energy, enthusiasm and creative courage of xinyao and its artists, and looks towards future generations of artists who will colour Singapores cultural tapestry.	14.75	15.0	14.5	15.0;14.5
