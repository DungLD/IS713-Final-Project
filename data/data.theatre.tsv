The elegant movements and stylised singing on stage emphasises the earthshaking, epic struggles faced by the protagonists Du and Liu. The production boasts a star-studded cast, featuring Plum Blossom Award winners Li Shu Qin as Du Li Niang and Liang Yao An as Liu Meng Mei, as well as veteran Cantonese Opera performer Peng Zhi Quan as the Supreme Judge. The stage design of this production is exquisitely designed and meticulously crafted, transforming the stage into an immersive setting that includes a garden with a beautifully detailed pavilion, complete with flowing streams. Together with a gripping storyline, elegant acting and melodious songs, it is little wonder that Peony My Beauty has been well-received at its performances in different cities in China and Hong Kong. Synopsis: In the back garden of the residence of Du Bao, the Governor of Nan’an, is situated the exquisite Peony Pavilion. Formerly a Taoist monastery, the pavilion is imbued with magical powers. Governor Du’s beautiful daughter Du Li Niang plants eight types of spring flowers around the pavilion, and her act of devotion touches the eight Flower Gods. In answer to her longing for true love, they reach into the future, bringing Liu Meng Mei, the son of the future Governor, into Li Niang’s dream. The two young people fall deeply in love, but are forcibly torn apart by a misguided Supreme Judge. Pining for her love, Li Niang wastes away in sorrow. Three years later, Meng Mei comes across the self-portrait of Li Niang when he visits the Peony Pavilion, and realises that the grave beside Tai Hu Lake belongs to the lover from his dream three years ago. Meng Mei is able to reunite with the ghost of Li Niang, but his life force is drained away by his ghostly lover, leaving him gravely ill. When the new Supreme Judge reviews Li Niang’s case, the Flower Gods defend her innocence. Eventually, Li Niang is vindicated and is given the Incense of Resurrection, allowing her to be reunited with Meng Mei in the world of living. However, Governor Du returns to his residence and mistakes Meng Mei for a thief. In the ensuing confusion, the Incense of Resurrection is broken, separating the lovers once again. Will the lovers be reunited eventually? About the troupe The troupe is currently headed by award-winning Cantonese Opera artist Li Shu Qin.

Defeating Zhou Yu – Main Cast: Pei Xiao Ming Showcasing spectacular martial arts feats, this excerpt is based on a story from Romance of the Three Kingdoms. For years, Liu Bei has been using a plot of borrowed land in Jingzhou province to train and house his troops and horses, with no intention of returning it. Zhou Yu thinks of a plan to seize the land back under the guise of helping Liu to conquer Xichuan province. However, his scheme is seen through by the brilliant Zhu Geliang, who lures Zhou to the gate of Chai San before surrounding his troops and defeating him. Wu Dalang Peddling Pastries – Main Cast: Zhou Wen, Wei Guo This excerpt is a wonderful showcase of the Martial Clown role in Cantonese Opera. Adapted from Water Margin, this story relates how Wu Song is reunited with his long-lost brother Wu Dalang. After Wu Song slays a ferocious tiger at Jingyang Ridge, he is made head constable in the county office. News of Wu Song’s tiger-slaying feat reaches the ears of Wu Dalang as he sets off to peddle his pastries and rushes off to meet his brother to bring him home. Li Huiniang Meeting the Judge – Main Cast: Liang Miao Tong, Feng Bao Tong During wartime, Li Huiniang and her father seek refuge in Hangzhou, where they earn their keep as street artists. The righteous Official Pei takes pity on them and gives them a treasured jade piece. But misfortune befalls Li when the tyrannical Court Official Jia forces her to be a songstress. One day, Jia and his songstresses visit the West Lake and run into Pei, and when Li compliments Pei, Jia is so incensed that he kills her and throws Pei in prison. Because of the injustice, Li’s soul is unable to move on to the afterworld, and she wanders aimlessly until she chances upon a righteous judge to whom she pours out her sorrows. She then receives a magic fan that enables her to return to the world of the living to save Pei. Lin Chong’s Capture – Main Cast: Lu Zhi Peng Adapted from the classic novel Water Margin, this story tells of Lin Chong’s journey, under armed escort, to the Kaifeng government office. Lin is on his way to exile at Cangzhou after having offended General Gao Qiu. During the journey, the two escorts, instigated by General Gao, try to kill Lin. They use numerous ways to torture him and just as they are about to deal the final blow, they reveal the real reason behind their brutal acts. Reunion at Luo River – Main Cast: Li Shu Qin, Ji Hua Sheng This excerpt relates a touching love story that happens towards the end of the Han dynasty. The three kingdoms Wei, Shu and Wu fight one another for supremacy. Cao Cao’s eldest son, Cao Pi distrusts his younger brother Cao Zhi. He persecutes Cao Zhi incessantly and also tries to capture the heart of his lover, Zhen Yuchan. Despairing at being caught in between the brothers, Zhen takes her own life at Luo River. Cao Zhi misses Zhen dearly and one day as he passes by the river, he crosses paths with her soul and the lovers exchange a pearl and jade piece for remembrance. Monkey King Borrows the Magic Fan – Main Cast: Chen Nai Cong, Li Qiu Hong Adapted from Journey to the West, Master Tang and his disciples are on their way to obtain the sutras when they find their path blocked by the Fiery Mountain. Only the magical fan of Princess Iron Fan can help them cross the mountain. Sun Wu Kong the Monkey King sets off to borrow the fan. But as he had previously defeated Red Boy (the Princess’ son) when the latter tried to eat Tang’s flesh, the Princess rejects Monkey King's request, triggering an epic battle between them. A Trick to Reveal the Truth – Main Cast: Zhong Jian Yong, Cao Xing Yu Adapted from the traditional story Fifteen Strings of Cash, this is the story of Lou the Rat who feels so flustered after committing a crime that he goes to pray at a temple. Suspecting something amiss, the magistrate Kuang Zhong disguises himself as a fortune-teller to read Lou’s fortune. He manages to get at the truth and bring him to justice.

This electrifying and testosterone-filled physical theatre ”horror show” exquisitely captures and transcends the spirit of Anthony Burgess’s original literary masterpiece, 50 years on from its publication. A Clockwork Orange lures its audience into the glorious glass-edged nastiness of Manchester’s underworld. A playtime of orgiastic ultraviolence and sexuality, it is the story of little Alex and his Droogs in their battle against the tedium of adolescence. An unapologetic jubilation of the human condition, it remains as terrifyingly relevant today as when the book was published in 1962 and when the Stanley Kubrick’s film caused a stir in 1971.
